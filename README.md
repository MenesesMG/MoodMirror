# MoodMirror

**MoodMirror** is a web application for facial expression recognition, leveraging the **Residual Masking Network** (RMN) for emotion detection. Initially a school project on **Google Colab**, the project has evolved into a fully deployed web app, built with **React** (frontend) and **Flask** (backend), styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

## Features

- **Facial Expression Detection**: Upload an image to detect facial expressions.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Powered by **Residual Masking Network** for accurate results.
- **Modern UI**: Built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Facial Expression Detection**: Residual Masking Network
- **Deployment**: Docker, Railway

## Project Origin and Evolution

MoodMirror started as a school experiment on **Google Colab**, aiming to explore the capabilities of deep learning models for emotion detection. Motivated by the promising results, it was transformed into a web app to make the functionality more accessible to users. 

The app uses **Residual Masking Network**, a state-of-the-art model designed for facial expression recognition, making it both innovative and practical.
